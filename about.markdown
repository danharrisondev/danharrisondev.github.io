Self-taught software engineer with 8 years of experience working in the automotive, finance, and HR sectors on projects ranging from payment gateways, third-party API integrations, administration portals, product search engines and booking systems. In addition to delivering a working product, I place a high value on readable code that is supported by a good set of tests as well as paired programming as a method of knowledge sharing.
